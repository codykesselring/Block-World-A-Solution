The Blocks World problem consists of a set of blocks 0-9 sitting on a table in random positions. The goal is to build one or more vertical stacks of blocks. Only one block may be moved at a time: it may either be placed on the table or placed atop another block. Because of this, any blocks that are, at a given time, under another block cannot be moved. This program uses an A* search algorithm to stack the blocks 0-9 in the least amount of moves.
